Kvazzup
=======

Kvazzup is an HEVC video call software written in C++ and built on [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework. Kvazzup makes use of the following open-source tools: Kvazaar for HEVC encoding, OpenHEVC for HEVC decoding, Opus Codec for audio encoding and decoding, uvgRTP for Streaming Media and Speex DSP for AEC. The aim of this project is to become a state-of-the-art Open-source Video Conferencing application as well as to provide a testbed for novel video call technologies that improve the video call experience.

Kvazzup is still under development and new features will become available. Current version has few small bugs due to recent completion of several key features. A bug-free release is currently in the works and is expected to be ready soon.

## Current features 

Currently Kvazzup has the following features:
- SIP server call initiation with anyone who has registered to the server.
- Peer-to-peer call intiation (firewall needs to have an open port 5060 for incoming TCP).
- Peer-to-peer media transport through firewall with ICE.
- Contact list.
- Enable/disable audio or video.
- Screen sharing.
- Live call parameter adjustment. 
- A statistics window for monitoring the call.
- Settings which are saved to disk.


## Compile Kvazzup

Kvazzup requires the following external libraries to run: 
- [Kvazaar](https://github.com/ultravideo/kvazaar) for video encoding.
- [OpenHEVC](https://github.com/OpenHEVC/openHEVC) for video decoding.
- [Opus](http://opus-codec.org/) for audio encoding and decoding.
- [uvgRTP](https://github.com/ultravideo/uvgRTP) for Media Delivery.
- [Speex DSP](https://www.speex.org/) for AEC.

Build these libraries using GCC, MinGW or MSVC compiler. Make sure you use the same compiler for all the dependencies and for Kvazzup. OpenMP also needs to be installed in your build environment or found in PATH. Qt Creator is the recommended tool for compiling Kvazzup. Please use dynamic version of kvazaar or define KVZ_STATIC_LIB in project file if you want to use the static library.


## Known issues

- Currently Visual Studio compilation does not succeed. Fix is pending.
- The Linux version of Kvazzup has a bug with QCamera which prevents from changing the default resolution. In addition the Opus codec is also disabled on Linux until issues with it have been resolved.


## Planned features

- Authentication (passwords)
- Contact presence monitoring
- Video conferences
- Encryption
- Automatic call parameter adjustment (currently everything is manual)
